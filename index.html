Reasons for referral for specialist assessment (intervention) include concern about speech, language or communication expressed by caregivers (which includes parents and guardians), teachers or healthcare professionals, or a lack of progress in language or scholastic attainment despite targeted classroom assistance; 2. Language impairments may go undetected. Referral for language assessment is recommended for children who present with behavioural or psychiatric difficulties, and for children with poor reading comprehension or listening difficulties; 10. Multiple sources of information should be combined in assessment, including interview/questionnaires with parents or caregivers, direct observation of the child, and standardized age-normed tests or criterion-based assessments.')"/>

onclick="writeText('CATALISE-2 (Bishop et al, 2017) noted importance of taking into account child’s language background. Statement 4 - Some children may have language needs because their first or home language differs from the local language, and they have had insufficient exposure to the language used by the school or community to be fully fluent in it. This should not be regarded as language disorder, unless there is evidence that the child does not have age‐appropriate skills in any language. CATALISE-1 (Bishop et al, 2016) discussed the issue of assessment in children with English as an Additional Language in statement 18. 18. Children with English as an Additional Language (EAL) pose challenges, because it can be difficult to determine if poor mastery of English reflects a genuine language problem or a lack of exposure to English. Where there is a language problem, this will be evident in the home language(s), but direct assessment of this may not be feasible. Report from a family member, by interview or checklist, may be able to clarify whether or not the childs skills in the home language are giving concern. Dynamic assessment (item 17) also has promise in this area.')"/>

onclick="writeText('Statement 3 (CATALISE-2) - Research evidence indicates that predictors of poor prognosis vary with a childs age, but in general language problems that affect a range of skills, and those affecting receptive language  are likely to persist. Under 3-years - Prediction of outcome is particularly hard in children under 3-years of age, and in general, it may be preferable to use a general diagnostic term such as `language difficulties` or  SLCN (`Speech, language and communication needs`) until the child is old enough to allow for more confident assessment of likely outcome. Many toddlers who have limited vocabulary at 18–24 months catch up, and it is difficult to identify which late talkers are likely to have long‐term problems. Prognosis is poorer for children with comprehension problems, and those who do not communicate via gesture. Three to four years - Prediction improves as children grow older; in 4‐year olds, the greater the number of areas of language functioning that is impaired, the higher the likelihood that the problems will persist into school age. A diagnosis of Language Disorder may be made for children with multiple areas of poor language skills, including comprehension. In contrast, there is generally a good prognosis for preschoolers whose problems are restricted to expressive phonology. Five years and over - Language problems that are still evident at 5-years and over are likely to persist. Children who start school with oral language problems are at risk of reading problems and poor academic attainment. Prognosis appears particularly poor when receptive language is impaired  and when nonverbal ability is relatively low.')"/>

onclick="writeText('As discussed in CATALISE-2 (Bishop et al, 2017) discussions about the term `disorder` revealed principled objections by those who were concerned about medicalisation of normal developmental variation. At the same time, concerns were expressed that other terminology might trivialise the challenges experienced by children who had persistent problems that interfered with their social and educational development. The solution we adopted was to retain `disorder` but define it in a way that required functional problems with a poor prognosis. In contrast to the usage in DSM-5, in CATALISE, `Language Disorder` is a generic term applied to those with severe, persistent language problems, regardless of presumed aetiology.')"/>

This may indicate a specific intervention pathway. Supplementary comment - Differentiating conditions include brain injury, acquired epileptic aphasia in childhood, certain neurodegenerative conditions, cerebral palsy and oral language limitations associated with sensori‐neural hearing loss as well as genetic conditions such as Down syndrome. We also include here children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and or intellectual disability because these conditions are commonly linked to genetic or neurological causes. These are all cases where an association between a biomedical condition and language disorder is commonly seen.')"/>

Additional comments - In practice, a differentiating condition would typically be the main diagnosis, with language disorder seen as a component of the condition. The CATALISE panel emphasised that the differentiating condition should not be seen as `explaining away` the language disorder, and that children with differentiating conditions should not be denied access to services. In such cases, the child requires support for the language problems, but the intervention pathway will need to take into account the distinctive features of the biomedical condition. See Bishop (2017) for further discussion of differentiating conditions.')"/>

Distinguishing these cases is important when doing research on aetiology, and is likely also to have implications for prognosis and intervention. `Developmental` in this context refers to the fact that the condition emerges in the course of development, rather than being acquired or associated with a known biomedical cause. The term `Developmental Language Disorder` is consistent with ICD‐11 and the diagnostic criteria are essentially identical to DSM-5 Language Disorder. It is recommended that when a diagnosis of DLD is made, that further information on co-occurring conditions, risk factors, and language profile is specified.')"/>

Supplementary comment - The terminology used for neurodevelopmental disorders can create the impression that there is a set of distinct conditions, but the reality is that many children have a mixture of problems.  Given our focus on DLD, our aim with this statement was to make it clear that presence of another neurodevelopmental diagnosis does not preclude DLD. The CATALISE panel considered including ASD as a co-occurring condition, but it was decided to regard it as a differentiating factor. There were several considerations: first,  a substantial minority of children with ASD have a clear genetic aetiology, and this is likely to increase with advances in genetic methods.  In addition, communication problems are a core diagnostic feature of ASD, albeit with wide variation in the severity and nature of the language problems. Also, the co‐occurring social and behavioural difficulties suggest the need for a distinctive intervention approach for ASD. It is also likely that where ASD and Language Disorder co-occur, ASD would be the primary diagnosis.')"/>

Nevertheless, it can be helpful for clinicians to pinpoint the principal areas for intervention, and researchers may decide to focus on children with specific characteristics to define more homogeneous samples for study. We suggest here some guidelines for more in‐depth analysis of language problems. Supplementary comment - The panel members did not reach good agreement on terminology for subgroups, and this may reflect the fact that, although attempts have been made to develop a classification of subtypes, these have not in general been validated as categories that are stable over time. The traditional distinction used in DSM, between receptive and expressive language disorder, is rather gross, and fails to indicate which aspects of language are proving problematic. We opted for an approach that uses specifiers indicating the principal dimensions of language difficulty, with a recommendation that assessment focus on identifying which areas are most impaired.')"/>
